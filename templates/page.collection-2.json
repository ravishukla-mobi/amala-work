Quite effortlessly, this gave fire to a little spiritual light from within which gave me a deep sense of peace - a connection to myself and a rekindling of my relationship with nature. The transformation had happened.Eventually came the calling, Amala Earth, inspired by the Amala Consciousness which is the ultimate form of purity in Buddhism. Through the world of Amala Earth, I seek to gently introduce the way to conscious living and grow a community of like-minded people.<\/p>",
